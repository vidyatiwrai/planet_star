    - Fetch and display information about planets from the SWAPI (`https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?format=json`).
    - Present each planet's data in a distinct card, including the planet's name, climate, population, and terrain.

2. **Residents Display:**
    - Within each planet's card, provide a list of residents fetched using their respective URLs found in the planet's data.
    - Display relevant details such as the resident's name, height, mass, and gender.

3. **Pagination Mechanism:**
    - Implement pagination functionality to navigate through the list of planets, leveraging the "next" URL provided in the API's response for fetching additional pages.
    - Ensure the pagination controls are user-friendly and intuitive.

4. **Styling and Responsiveness:**
    - Use CSS to style the application, emphasizing a clean, engaging layout and responsive design.
